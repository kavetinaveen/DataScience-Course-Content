# Problems

1. Predict Boston housing prices:

The file *Boston_housing_prices.csv* contains information collected by the US Beaureu of the census concerning housing in the area of Boston, Massachusetts.  The dataset includes information on 505 census housing tracts in the Boston area. The goal is to predict the median house price in new tracts based on information such as crime rate, pollution, and number of rooms. The dataset contains 14 predictors and the response is the median house price (MEDV). Variable description available in Data *Descritption - Boston housing prices.csv*

Objective - To predict the median house price

2. Predicting Blood Donations

The [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.html) is a great resource for practicing your data science skills. They provide a wide range of datasets for testing machine learning algorithms. Finding a subject matter you're interested in can be a great way to test yourself on real-world data problems. Given our mission, we're interested in predicting if a blood donor will donate within a given time window.

Objective - To predict the last column, whether he/she donated blood in March 2007.
